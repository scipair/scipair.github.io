## things to fix in this app
- also the app doesnt have good url management, i wish if we put 2 authors, the url would have their open alex ids, so i can share it with others quickly and they can see what im seeing. currently, it only puts the id of the first author and if i take that url and paste it to another tab, it just hangs, cause it cant fetch and show the data of both the authors properly
- also why is there a weird /#; in the url, can we please remove it?

- also, remove all the console log messages and dont talk much about the deduplication cause it doesnt make much difference tbh.


- it is not mobile friendly at all
    - on the compairson tab, the first author data occupies the whole screen and u have to scroll all the way down to find the 2nd author
    - in analytics, the information is too big for mobile over each graph, i wish it was more condensed or collapsible, also the graphs arent displaying propely they're all squished and not readable at all
